pocketsmith-tg-bot is in the public domain and does not require a license. Even so, some organizations want legal proof of their right to use pocketsmith-tg-bot. Circumstances where this might occurs include the following:

- Your company desires indemnity against claims of copyright infringement.
- You are using pocketsmith-tg-bot in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the public domain.
- You are using pocketsmith-tg-bot in a jurisdiction that does not recognize the right of an author to dedicate their work to the public domain.
- You want to hold a tangible legal document as evidence that you have the legal right to use and distribute pocketsmith-tg-bot.
- Your legal department tells you that you must purchase a license.

If any of the above circumstances apply to you, Leandro Barba, the person who develops pocketsmith-tg-bot, will sell you a Warranty of Title for pocketsmith-tg-bot. A Warranty of Title is a legal document that asserts that the claimed authors of pocketsmith-tg-bot are the true authors, and that the authors have the legal right to dedicate the pocketsmith-tg-bot to the public domain, and Leandro Barba will vigorously defend against challenges to those claims.
